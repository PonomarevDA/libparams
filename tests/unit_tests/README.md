# Unit tests

Here we have all primaries libparams unit tests.

As well as the application, they are divided into a 3 files:
- test_storage.cpp
- test_rom.cpp
- test_flash_driver.cpp

To run the tests, you should just type:

```bash
make
```

in this folder.

This tests are part of [the build CI](.github/workflows/build.yml).
